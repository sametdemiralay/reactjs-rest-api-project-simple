## Explanation

I used [json-sever](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) in this project therefore before running this project you have to run it on your localhost. db.json in the localhost you created, it should be like the below.

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
}
```
